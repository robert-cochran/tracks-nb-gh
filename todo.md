# High
- [ ] get extension working to easily save track urls in browser tab to disk
    - or maybe some easy way to save your playlist to a url? that way it can be saved as a bookmark
- [ ] add filters and tags
- [ ] drag and drop feature to import songs
- [ ] export feature to save songs added
- [ ] TODO filter duplicates out
- [ ] TODO strike out videos that cant be played
- [ ] TODO add videos to table
- [ ] easily creatable/saveable anonymous playlists



# Med
- [ ] have add local options but also save those as a bundle to a external repo
- [ ] maybe make seperate files and then bundle them up together into a single file that can be dropped into any repo


# Low
- [ ] consider adding mongodb read/write 
    - [ ] maybe make playlists social like how youtube used to be, let people discover other music like a webring
    - [ ] could do meta analysis then and look at most used tags, most saved track, users that share the most in common with you, suggested songs???
- [ ] setup an autosync feature that doesnt save them through bookmarks 
    - dunno about this one, nb-bookmarks works well and would only need to be done if extended to store/retriece track urls outside github
