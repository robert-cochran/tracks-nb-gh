tracks

about

    Code to create personal youtube in a html page. 
    Tracks html page is generated by github using github pages.
    'Tracks' are youtube link stored in a tracks.md file
    Currently my tracks.md are being stored in a separate git synced repo (nb)
    but can be loaded from a file from the page to load a custom set of tracks
    to listen to.
    To see it working go to https://robert-cochran.github.io/tracks-nb-gh/
